# Example rollupjs project to illustrate tree shaking 

To run simply clone the repo, npm install, then npm run build.
```
> npm install
> npm run build
```

Open a browser to localhost:10001 to see the rendered webpage and look at the index.min.js file in the dist directory which includes only code used rather than all code in the required module.
